Hello:)
welcome to my space!

I am Jarsha Veronika S. Jasareno a grade-9 student from Ateneo De Naga University.

Here is where you will find all my hobbies and talents!
       
1. DANCING

I began dancing when I was 4 years old. I tried to dance ballet up until the age of 8, when I began to take contemporary classes.


  I actually find all dance forms to be enjoyable:)
